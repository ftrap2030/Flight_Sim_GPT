"""Airfields: somewhere to go, and somewhere to land.

Two sources behind one interface, so nothing downstream cares which produced a
given field:

* **Procedural** -- infinite, seeded, generated on demand. Fields are placed by
  searching for genuinely flat ground rather than by dropping a runway wherever
  a hash says so, and the runway is aligned with the flattest axis, which in
  mountainous country means it naturally follows the valley.
* **Authored** -- a hand-designed home region with named fields of deliberately
  varied difficulty. Their identities are authored; their exact positions still
  snap to flat ground found by the same search, so they sit in the same terrain
  as everything else with no seam and no separate elevation function.

Runways are graded flat, because real airports are bulldozed and a runway laid
over raw ridged noise has a two-hundred-foot hump in it. Site selection reads
`Terrain.natural_elevation` and grading is applied afterwards, so the search that
places a runway never sees the flattening it will cause.
