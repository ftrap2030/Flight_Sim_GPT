"""Procedural terrain.

Ridged multifractal noise over a hashed integer lattice. Ridged rather than
plain fractal Brownian motion because the brief calls for *jagged* ridges and
deep valleys: taking 1 - |noise| folds the field at its midline, turning smooth
hills into sharp crests, and squaring sharpens them further.

A slow, large-scale "massif" field modulates the local relief, so the world has
genuine plains, foothills and high country rather than uniform corrugation. Peak
elevations reach roughly 9,600 ft -- squarely in the path of an airliner at
5,000 ft, which is the point: the low-altitude band needs real teeth.

Everything is a pure function of (x, y, seed), so the world is infinite,
deterministic and needs no storage.
