"""Track-up ASCII plan view of the surrounding terrain.

The instrument panel answers "what is directly ahead of me?" with a single
number. That is not enough to fly a valley: at 1,500 ft in cloud you need to
know whether the ground opens to the left or the right, and the panel cannot
tell you. This does.

Terrain is drawn *relative to the aircraft's own altitude*, not as absolute
elevation, because the only question that matters at low level is what you can
hit. Ground far below you and ground about to kill you should not look alike.

The view is track-up -- the nose always points up the page -- since that is how
a pilot thinks in the moment, and the aircraft sits low in the grid so most of
the display is the ground you are flying toward rather than the ground you have
already survived.
