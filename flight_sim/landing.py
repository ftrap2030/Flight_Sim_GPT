"""Approach guidance, touchdown assessment and the rollout.

Until now a flight could only end badly: the terminal states were a crash, a
break-up, or quitting. This is the other ending.

Ground contact is no longer one question ("am I below the terrain?") but two:
where did I touch, and how. Touching down anywhere but a runway is still a
crash. Touching down *on* one is judged the way a real arrival is judged --
sink rate first, then speed against Vref, then how straight and how centred --
and it can still go wrong.
