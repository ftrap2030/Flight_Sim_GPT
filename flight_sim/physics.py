"""Point-mass flight dynamics.

One pilot command advances the simulation by TICK_SECONDS, integrated with
semi-implicit Euler at 0.1 s substeps. The substepping matters: turn rate and
flight path angle are coupled through airspeed, and a 10-second Euler step on
that coupling diverges badly at low speed.

The state is deliberately small and fully serialisable, so a session can be
persisted to JSON between turns and resumed exactly.
